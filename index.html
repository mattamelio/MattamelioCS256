  <h1>Hi! My name is Matt Amelio</h1>
  <p>I am from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and I am a graduating in 2022. <a href="http://www.kings.edu">King's College</a>.</p>


  <h2> Computer Science Autobiography </h2>

  <p> Since I could remember technology has been apart of my life.  One of the main reasons for that is because both my parent's
      careers involve technolgy, which in a way lead to me taking an interest in computers.  I remember using a computer for the
      first time using my dad's computer for homework.  I can not specifically name one event that made me interested in computer
      science, but I believe both my parents working with technology led me to it.  Also, knowing that the whole world involves
      technolgy had an impact as well.  I have only used a couple of programming languages those being Java and Python.  Being able
      to take this course is interesting for me because it allows me to create my first website and database.  Hopefully, this will
      allow me to be able to do this on my own and use it in my career.  In the future I believe programming will be a huge part of
      my life.  I plan on using my programming skills for my future career and maybe even help me start my own business with my
      roommate. </p>
